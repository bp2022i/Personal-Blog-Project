                This is the start of my quarantine and my plans to
                move out of London before the cases of COVID-19 have
                accelerated rapidly. For the fear of catching the virus
                and spreding it to the famliy.

                compromised and had just recoverd form a case of pneumonia
                that happned at Chritmas.
